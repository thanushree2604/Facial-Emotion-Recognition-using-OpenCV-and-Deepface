# Facial Emotion Recognition using OpenCV and DeepFace

A real-time facial emotion recognition system built using **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **DeepFace** that detects human emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **surprised**, and **neutral** through webcam feed.

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Emotion analysis using DeepFace pre-trained models.
- Live video stream display with emotion labels.
- Supports multiple emotions and real-time updates.
- Simple to run and extend for research or projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenCV**
- **DeepFace**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thanushree2604/Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface.git
   cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > ⚠️ If you face NumPy compatibility errors, run:
   > ```bash
   > pip install numpy==1.26.4
   > ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python emotion.py
   ```

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Opens your system’s webcam feed.
2. Detects faces in real time using OpenCV.
3. Uses DeepFace to analyze each detected face.
4. Displays the predicted emotion label on the screen.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add gender and age prediction.
- Improve UI using Streamlit or Flask.
- Support for emotion logging and analytics.
- Integrate with datasets for training custom models.
